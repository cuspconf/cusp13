The [thirteenth](/cusp13 "CUSP-13") annual meeting of [California Universities Semantics and Pragmatics](/ "CUSP") (CUSP) will take place at UCLA on **May 6, 2022**. The meeting will, as always, be a friendly and informal venue for graduate students to present their work. We invite submissions of abstracts for talks on any topics under the umbrella of semantics and pragmatics. There will be no formal review process, and we hope to accept as close to 100% of appropriate submissions as possible, volume permitting.

The abstract submission deadline is Monday, **March 21, 2022**.

Submitted abstracts should follow these guidelines:
- Abstracts should be no more than one page long, excluding figures and references
- Abstracts should **not** be anonymized—they should include the authors’ names and affiliations (as well as a title)
- Abstracts should be submitted in PDF format to [cuspucla@gmail.com](mailto:cuspucla@gmail.com "submit abstracts to cuspucla@gmail.com") with the subject line “CUSP submission” no later than 11:59pm CA time on March 21
- Please include the authors’ status (PhD student, postdoc, etc.) in the body of the email
